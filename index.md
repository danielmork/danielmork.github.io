## About Me
Welcome to my personal webpage. I am currently a PhD candidate in Statistics at Colorado State University (CSU). My research interests include: statistical machine learning, functional regression, variable selection, effect heterogeneity and causal inference. Prior to pursuing a statistics degree at CSU, I taught high school math in Greeley, CO, worked in Logsitics and Analytics for Target Corp., and ran a web development and marketing company. In my free time I enjoy biking, skiing, camping, and gardening.

## Current Research
Humans encounter a wide array of chemical and nonchemical stressors on a daily basis. These stressors may act individually or in combination to alter health status. My research focuses on developing statistical methodology and software to understand the relationships between air pollution and health.  I explore innovative, Bayesian machine learning methods that seek to unravel these complexities in environmental health while accounting for a range of demographic, spatial, or temporal considerations. Simultaneously, I create user-friendly software for efficient application and reproducibility in epidemiological studies.
