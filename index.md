## About Me
Welcome to my personal webpage. I am currently a PhD candidate in [Statistics at Colorado State University](https://statistics.colostate.edu/) (CSU). My research interests include: statistical machine learning, functional regression, variable selection, effect heterogeneity and causal inference. Beyond these, I am always excited to explore new problems and methods. Prior to pursuing a statistics degree at CSU, I taught high school math in Greeley, CO where I implemented a system focused on personalized learning, and worked for Target Corporation where I managed a range of workforce and procurement analytics and merged diverse data sources to develop data-driven tools for workflow optimization and cost efficiency. In my free time I enjoy biking, skiing, camping, and gardening.

## Current Research
Humans encounter a wide array of chemical and nonchemical stressors on a daily basis. These stressors may act individually or in combination to alter health status. My current research focuses on developing statistical methodology and software to understand the relationships between air pollution and health.  I explore innovative, Bayesian machine learning methods that seek to unravel these complexities in environmental health while accounting for a range of demographic, spatial, or temporal considerations. Simultaneously, I create user-friendly software for efficient application and reproducibility in epidemiological studies.

- Machine learning methods for characterizing coffee beans using mass spectrometry data (2020)
- Relationships between sleep and activity habits of practicing physicians (2020)
- Analysis of the presence of cataracts in Siberian Husky versus other dog breeds (2020)
- Statistical methods to study sorghum metabolic system alterations across the growing season, under water or nitrogen stress conditions (2019)
- Statistical models for local dust storm prediction in the South-West United States (2017 - 2018)
