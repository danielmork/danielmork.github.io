## About Me
Welcome to my personal webpage. I am currently a PhD candidate in Statistics at Colorado State University (CSU). My research is related to development of distributed lag linear and non-linear models, with applications to air pollution and children's health. Key statistical topics within my work include functional regression, variable and confounder selection, MCMC algorithms, and hierarchical Bayesian models.

Prior to pursuing a statistics degree at CSU, I taught high school math in Greeley, CO, worked in Logsitics and Analytics for Target Corp., and ran a web development and marketing company. In my free time I enjoy biking, skiing, camping, and gardening.
