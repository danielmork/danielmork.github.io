Welcome to my personal webpage. I am a research scientist in the [Department of Biostatistics at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) working with [National Studies on Air Pollution and Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nsaph/). My statistical interests include [structured machine learning](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/biom.13568), [effect heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13763), [functional regression](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxaa051), [causal inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03011), [Bayesian methodology and computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12937), and analysis of [large, complex data](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2022.107694). My work has been motivated and applied to a range of scientific questions in environmental and public health. Simultaneously, I create user-friendly software for efficient application and reproducibility in epidemiological studies. In addition, I enjoy consulting and collaborating in new areas of research and scientific exploration.  

I received my PhD in Statistics from [Colorado State University](https://statistics.colostate.edu/), where my dissertation focused on developing machine learning methods to understand the relationships between air pollution exposures during gestation and children's birth and health outcomes. During graduate school I also worked as a statistical consultant with the [Graybill Statistics and Data Science Laboratory](https://statlab.colostate.edu/). Prior to my work as a statistician, I taught high school math at [Greeley West High School](https://www.greeleyschools.org/Domain/29) in Greeley, CO where I implemented a personalized learning system; worked for [Target Corporation](https://corporate.target.com) where I managed a range of workforce and procurement analytics and created data-driven tools for workflow optimization and cost efficiency; and was a web developer specializing in database-driven web services.

In my free time I enjoy biking, skiing, camping, and gardening.
