## About Me
Welcome to my personal webpage. I am currently a PhD candidate in Statistics at Colorado State University (CSU). My current work is in the development of distributed lag linear and non-linear models, with applications to environmental health. 

Prior to pursuing a statistics degree at CSU, I taught high school math in Greeley, CO, worked in Analytics for Target corp., and ran a web development and marketing company. In my free time I enjoy biking, fishing, canoeing, and gardening.
